I have done Data Science related project in this intern. Codsoft assigned three tasks to complete it.

MOVIE RATING:
     In this project is to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.The goal is to analyze 
historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:
     In this project is to Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:
    In this project is to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling orundersampling for improving results.
